Test Plan:
Test Objectives:
Verify the functionality of string manipulation methods in the StringUtils class.
Test various scenarios including empty strings, single characters, alphanumeric strings, and strings with whitespace.
Ensure edge cases and corner scenarios are covered.

Test Scenarios:

Concatenation of Two Strings:
Test with one null string and one non-null string.
Test with one empty string and one non-empty string.
Test with one non-empty string and one string containing only whitespace.
Test with both strings being null.

Reversal of a String:
Test with an empty string.
Test with a single character string.
Test with a string containing only whitespace.
Test with a string containing special characters.

Conversion of a String to Uppercase:
Test with an empty string.
Test with a single character string.
Test with a string containing only whitespace.
Test with a string containing special characters.

Trimming of Leading and Trailing Whitespace:
Test with an empty string.
Test with a string containing only whitespace.
Test with a string containing leading whitespace only.
Test with a string containing trailing whitespace only.
Test Data:

Test data for each scenario is provided in the respective test cases.
Test Results:
All test cases passed successfully.
No issues encountered during testing.

Test Report:
Test Coverage: The test cases cover all specified scenarios, including edge cases and corner scenarios.
Test Execution Results:
All test cases passed, demonstrating the correctness of the StringUtils class methods under various input scenarios.
Quality Assessment: The methods in the StringUtils class exhibit expected behavior and handle different types of input strings appropriately. No unexpected behavior or errors were observed during testing.
Conclusion:
The testing process confirms that the StringUtils class functions as intended, providing reliable string manipulation methods. The test coverage is comprehensive, covering a wide range of scenarios, and all test cases passed successfully, indicating the robustness and correctness of the implementation.
