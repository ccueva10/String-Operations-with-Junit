Project Description
In this project, we implement JUnit parameterized tests to validate various string operations. The objective is to familiarize ourselves with the usage of JUnit's @Parameters annotation to execute parameterized tests with non-numerical types, specifically focusing on string inputs. We'll write test cases to verify the correctness of string manipulation methods under different input scenarios.# String-Operations-with-Junit
